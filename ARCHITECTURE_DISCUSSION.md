# Chat Service Architecture Discussion Summary

## Key Design Questions & Trade-offs Explored

### 1. Message Routing: HTTP vs Message Queue

**Question**: Should chat servers send messages via HTTP to routing service, or use an intermediate message queue?

**Current Choice**: HTTP to routing service
- ✅ **Immediate feedback**: Know if message routing succeeded/failed
- ✅ **Simple debugging**: Direct request-response flow  
- ✅ **Lower latency**: One less hop in message path
- ❌ **Tight coupling**: Chat servers depend on routing service availability
- ❌ **Blocking**: Chat server waits for routing response

**Alternative**: Message queue between chat server → routing service
- ✅ **Decoupling**: Services can fail independently
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Fire-and-forget messaging
- ❌ **No immediate feedback**: Can't confirm delivery success
- ❌ **Higher complexity**: Additional queue management

**Conclusion**: HTTP is better when delivery confirmation is needed. Queue approach better for high-throughput scenarios where some message loss is acceptable.

### 2. Message Persistence Strategy

**Question**: Where and when should messages be persisted?

**Options Analyzed**:

1. **Routing Service (Before Queue)**
   - ✅ Guaranteed persistence even if routing fails
   - ❌ Database writes block message routing performance

2. **Chat Server (In-Memory + Batch)**
   - ✅ High performance, no blocking
   - ❌ Data loss risk if server crashes before disconnect

3. **Background Worker (Recommended)**
   - ✅ Non-blocking + guaranteed persistence via Redis queue
   - ✅ Scalable processing
   - ❌ Additional complexity

**Conclusion**: Background worker approach provides best balance of performance and reliability.

### 3. Service Decomposition

**Question**: Should routing service handle multiple responsibilities or be split?

**Current**: Single routing service handles:
- Client-server assignment
- Message routing  
- Online user discovery

**Pros**: Simple deployment, shared state, low latency
**Cons**: Mixed scaling needs, single point of failure

**When to split**: >10k msg/sec, >100k users, different team ownership

### 4. Routing Service Scaling

**Question**: Can routing service be scaled horizontally?

**Current Problem**: In-memory round-robin counter
```javascript
let currentServerIndex = 0; // ❌ Breaks with multiple instances
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Hash-based**: `clientId % serverCount` (stateless)
2. **Redis counter**: `INCR server-counter` (true round-robin)  
3. **Load balancer**: nginx → multiple routing instances

**Architecture**:
```
Clients → Load Balancer → Multiple Routing Services → Redis
```

### 5. Chat Room Persistence & Reconnection

**Question**: How to handle chat room state when clients disconnect/reconnect?

**Problem**: Current chat rooms only exist in browser memory, lost on refresh.

**Solutions**:

1. **Browser Storage (Simple)**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('chatRooms', JSON.stringify(rooms));
   ```

2. **Server-Side Registry**
   ```javascript
   // Redis: rooms:user123 → [room1, room2, room3]
   ```

3. **Database-Backed Rooms**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE chat_rooms (id, participant1, participant2, created_at);
   ```

**Key Insight**: Don't auto-restore all rooms → creates empty chatboxes. Use lazy loading instead.

### 6. Socket Connection Timing

**Question**: When should client create WebSocket connection?

**Answer**: Immediately on page load, before loading chat rooms.

**Reasoning**: 
- User can receive messages even if chatbox not open yet
- No missed messages during page load
- Real-time notifications possible

### 7. Message Delivery with Room Persistence

**Question**: How does message routing work with room persistence?

**Key Insight**: Room ID is a **storage concept**, not a **routing concept**.

**Usage Separation**:
- **Room ID used for**: Loading chat list, message history, database storage
- **Client ID used for**: Real-time message routing, WebSocket targeting

**Message Flow** (unchanged):
```
Client A → Chat Server → Routing Service → Target Chat Server → Client B
```

**Database Flow** (new):
```
Message → Background Worker → Database (with derived room_id)
```

## Final Architecture Recommendations

### Current Scale (Prototype)
- Keep HTTP routing for delivery confirmation
- Single routing service (simple deployment)
- Add localStorage for chat room persistence
- Add background worker for message history

### Future Scale (Production)
- Consider message queues for high throughput
- Split services when scaling needs differ
- Add database-backed room persistence
- Implement horizontal routing service scaling

### Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate**: localStorage chat room persistence
2. **Short-term**: Background worker for message history  
3. **Medium-term**: Database-backed rooms and history
4. **Long-term**: Service decomposition and horizontal scaling

## Key Architectural Principles Identified

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Storage vs Routing vs Real-time delivery
2. **Performance vs Reliability**: Choose based on requirements
3. **Scaling Patterns**: Identify bottlenecks before optimizing
4. **State Management**: Distinguish between transient and persistent state
5. **User Experience**: Socket connection timing affects message delivery
6. **Data Consistency**: Room persistence vs real-time routing can use different models
